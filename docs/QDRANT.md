Qdrant Collection Status & Config Breakdown

- **status:** `green`  
    The collection is healthy and ready for queries.

- **optimizer_status:** `ok`  
    The optimizer is functioning normally.

- **indexed_vectors_count:** `0`  
    No vectors have been indexed for fast search (may be due to configuration or recent changes).

- **points_count:** `2502`  
    There are 2,502 points (records) in the collection.

- **segments_count:** `8`  
    Data is split into 8 segments for efficient storage and search.

Configs
- **params**
    - **vectors**
        - `size: 512` — Each vector has 512 dimensions.
        - `distance: Cosine` — Cosine similarity is used for searching.
    - `shard_number: 1` — The collection has 1 shard (partition).
    - `replication_factor: 1` — No data replication (single copy).
    - `write_consistency_factor: 1` — Write operations require confirmation from 1 node.
    - `on_disk_payload: true` — Payload data is stored on disk, not in memory.

- **hnsw_config**
    - `m: 16` — Number of edges per node in the HNSW graph.
    - `ef_construct: 100` — Controls index construction quality/speed.
    - `full_scan_threshold: 10000` — Above this, a full scan is used instead of HNSW.
    - `max_indexing_threads: 0` — Uses default thread count for indexing.
    - `on_disk: false` — HNSW index is stored in memory.

- **optimizer_config**
    - `deleted_threshold: 0.2` — Segments are optimized if 20% of points are deleted.
    - `vacuum_min_vector_number: 1000` — Minimum vectors before vacuuming (clean-up).
    - `default_segment_number: 0` — Uses default segment count.
    - `indexing_threshold: 20000` — Index optimization triggers above this point count.
    - `flush_interval_sec: 5` — Data is flushed to disk every 5 seconds.

- **wal_config**
    - `wal_capacity_mb: 32` — Write-ahead log size is 32 MB.
    - `wal_segments_ahead: 0` — No extra WAL segments kept ahead.

- **quantization_config:** `null`  
    No quantization (compression) is configured.
